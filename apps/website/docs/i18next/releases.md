# Releases policy of `@withease/i18next`

::: tip
This library does not follow the same [release cycle as other libraries in the With Ease organization](/statements/releases) because it is bound to the release cycle of `i18next` itself.
:::

The major version of this library is bound to the major version of `i18next` itself. For example, `@withease/i18next@22.x.x` is compatible with `i18next@22.x.x` and is tested against it.

Major version of this library can include breaking changes, but it will be soundness.
